# Medical Insurance Premium Prediction

This project implements a Machine Learning model to predict medical insurance premiums based on demographic and health-related features. By analyzing the key factors affecting insurance costs, the project provides valuable insights into pricing strategies and customer segmentation.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for optimal model performance.
- Regression models such as Random Forest and XGBoost for accurate predictions.
- Visualization of key features and their impact on insurance premiums.
- Evaluation using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and RÂ² score.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for implementation.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating regression models.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizing results and feature importance.

## Dataset
